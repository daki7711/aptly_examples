Create an app where a ball is bouncing around the screen, when the ball hits a wall it bounces back

Screen1 = Screen(AppName = 'BallBounce', ShowListsAsJson = False, Sizing = 'Fixed', Title = 'Screen1', TutorialURL = 'http://appinventor.mit.edu/yrtoolkit/yr/tutorials/ball_bounce.html')
Canvas1 = Canvas(Screen1, Height = -2, Width = -2)
Ball1 = Ball(Canvas1, PaintColor = '&HFF0000FF', Radius = 10, X = 190, Y = 133)

when Ball1.Flung():
  set Ball1.Heading = heading
  set Ball1.Speed = speed

when Ball1.EdgeReached():
  call Ball1.Bounce(edge)
