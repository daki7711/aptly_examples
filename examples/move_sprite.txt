Create an app where you are able to move a sprite based on the orientation of your phone.

START
Screen1 = Screen(ScreenOrientation = "Portrait")
MyCanvas = Canvas(Screen1, Height = 300, Width = 300)
Bug = ImageSprite(MyCanvas, Interval = 10, Picture = "bug.png", X = 124, Y = 86)
OrientationSensor1 = OrientationSensor()
Clock1 = Clock(TimerAlwaysFires = True, TimerEnabled = True, TimerInterval = 10)

to MoveBug():
	set Bug.Heading = OrientationSensor1.Angle
	set Bug.Speed = OrientationSensor1.Magnitude * 100

when ClockTimer1.Timer():
	call MoveBug()
STOP
