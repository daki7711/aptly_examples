Create an app with a picture of a kitty that the user can draw on. When the screen is tapped, a circle should be drawn. Allow the user to switch their paint colors by having red, blue and green buttons that change the paint color when pressed. Allow the user to change the background of the canvas by taking a photo. When a wipe button is pressed, the drawings should be cleared.
