Create a game called HitIt where you are able to move a sprite based on the orientation of your phone. When the sprite touches a black ball on the screen, add one to the player's score and reposition the black ball. If the player clicks a reset button, set the score to zero

START
Screen1 = Screen()
MyCanvas = Canvas(Screen1, Height = 300, Width = 300)
Ball = ImageSprite(MyCanvas, Picture = "ball.png", X = 124, Y = 86)
ScoreLabel = Label(Screen1, Text = "---")
ResetButton = Button(Screen1, Text = "Reset")
Noise = Sound(Screen1, Interval = 500)
BallTimer = Clock(Screen1, TimerInterval = 1000)

initialize score = 0

to UpdateScore():
    set ScoreLabel.Text = join("Score: ", score)

to MoveBall():
    set Ball.X = random_fraction() * (MyCanvas.Width - Ball.Width)
    set Ball.Y = random_fraction() * (MyCanvas.Height - Ball.Height)

when Ball.Touched(x, y):
    set score = score + 1
    call Noise.Vibrate(100)
    call UpdateScore()
    call MoveBall()

when BallTimer.Timer():
    call MoveBall()

when ResetButton.Click():
    set score = 0
    call UpdateScore()
STOP
