Create an app with a canvas that a user can draw on if they drag their finger across the screen. If the user clicks a red button, change the paint color to red. If the user clicks a blue button, change the paint color to blue. If the user clicks a green button, change the paint color to green.

START
Screen1 = Screen()
MyCanvas = Canvas(Screen1, Height = 300, Width = 300)
RedButton = Button(Screen1, Text = "Red")
BlueButton = Button(Screen1, Text = "Blue")
GreenButton = Button(Screen1, Text = "Green")

when MyCanvas.Dragged(startX, startY, prevX, prevY, currentX, currentY):
  call MyCanvas.DrawLine(prevX, prevY, currentX, currentY)

when RedButton.Click():
  set MyCanvas.PaintColor = "Red"

when BlueButton.Click():
  set MyCanvas.PaintColor = "Blue"

when GreenButton.Click():
  set MyCanvas.PaintColor = "Green"
STOP
