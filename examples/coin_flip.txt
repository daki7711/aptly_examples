Create an app with a button that simulates flipping a coin. A image of coin appears corresponding to the outcome.

START
Screen1 = Screen()
Coin = Button(Screen1, Text = "Flip Coin")
Heads = Image(Screen1, Picture = "heads.png", Visible = False)
Tails = Image(Screen1, Picture = "tails.png", Visible = False)

initialize flip = False

when Coin.Click():
  set flip = (math_random_int(0, 1) == 1)
  set Heads.Visible = flip
  set Tails.Visible = not flip
STOP
